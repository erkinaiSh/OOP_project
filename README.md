# OOP_project

This project helps you to find useful for you information from really many tables or spreadsheets with their id 
or by other titles. In my case I have did it with movie spreadsheet where we have reallly much data and you can not just look and search.
Actually, I wanted do this project with students' information in Internetional University of Ala-Too, but I could not find that information, so, I 
took existed spreadsheet of movies.
